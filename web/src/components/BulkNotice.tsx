/**
 * An inline banner for something a bulk action needs to tell the user that is
 * not an exception: today, "nothing was searched because automatic grabbing is
 * off" (#2669).
 *
 * The Books and Authors pages had no place at all to say such a thing. Their
 * only failure affordance was `alert()` in a catch block, which never fired
 * here because the server answers 200 with a per id reason. A banner rather
 * than an alert so it does not block the page, and `role="alert"` so a screen
 * reader announces it without the user having to go looking.
 *
 * It stays until dismissed or until the next bulk action replaces it. Nothing
 * auto hides it, because the message asks the user to go and change a setting.
