// existingBookSeriesLinker writes provider series refs onto books the library
// ALREADY has, during a catalogue sync.
//
// Until #2328 series membership was written in exactly one place,
// handleNewWantedBook, which runs only over the books a sync creates. Both
// branches that recognise an existing row return to the top of the loop before
// reaching it, so on an imported library, where every work resolves to a row
// that is already there and the author's monitoring refuses new ones, a
// refresh updated ratings, covers and genres and could never link a series.
// That left no way at all to repair series membership, which is most of what
// "relink this author to a better record and refresh" is for.
//
// # What the snapshot can and cannot answer
//
// The linker holds one author-scoped snapshot of current memberships so the
// common case costs one query for the whole sync. That snapshot describes the
// books that were under this author when it was taken, and NOTHING else, which
// is the trap the first version of this fell into: both call sites can hand it
// a book the snapshot has never heard of, and an absent book reads as "this
// book is in no series at all". Two such books exist:
//
//   - the id-resolved branch matches globally, so its row can still belong to
//     another author. reparentMisattachedBook deliberately leaves a genuinely
//     co-authored row where it is, so this is a permanent state, not a race.
//   - the title branch sees books created by this very run, because the create
//     loop adds them to seenTitles as it goes.
//
// So: refs aimed at a book this run created are held and written by
// linkDeferred once the create path has finished with it, because those two
// writers would otherwise fight over which series is primary. Any other book
// the snapshot does not cover gets one membership query of its own, cached for
// the rest of the sync.
//
// The primary flag is never decided from the snapshot at all. It is decided at
// write time by LinkBookPreservingPrimary, which re-reads HasPrimarySeries, so
// a stale or absent snapshot entry cannot produce the second primary_series=1
// row that #2525 exists to prevent. The residual window is the two statements
// inside that call: a concurrent series fill can still slip a primary in
// between them. Closing it needs a partial unique index on the table, which is
// a migration and not this change. No duplicate membership is possible at any
// time, concurrently or not, because series_books is keyed on
// (series_id, book_id) and every insert here is INSERT OR IGNORE.
//
// # Cost
//
// It runs for every book of every author on every refresh, including the
// unattended discovery pass, so:
//   - no provider call, ever. The refs come from the works fetch the sync has
//     already made, off the same models.Book the create path reads them from.
//   - one SELECT per sync, taken lazily on the first existing book that
//     carries a series ref, plus one per book the snapshot cannot cover (in
//     practice zero: it takes a co-authored work to produce one).
//   - per link actually written: the HasPrimarySeries read inside
//     LinkBookPreservingPrimary, the insert, and the series upsert when the
//     series is new to this sync. A library already in the right shape writes
//     nothing and reads only the snapshot.
//
// It is not safe for concurrent use; a catalogue sync holds the author's lock
// and walks its works serially.
