// Which name a library scan believes when the filename and the folder it sits
// in disagree (#2171).
//
// The scan used to let the folder win outright: a file under
// <root>/<Author>/<Book>/<file> took its title from the immediate parent
// folder, whatever the filename said. That is right for the layout it was
// written for (Author/Book Title/Book Title.epub) and wrong for every library
// that puts a box set or a series in that slot, because
// "Author/The Wheel of Time/01 - The Eye of the World (1990).epub" is then
// titled "The Wheel of Time". The file reconciles onto the series opener, or
// onto nothing, and the book it really is stays Wanted.
//
// Bulk import already resolved this the other way round: lookupUnit computes
// its effective title as firstNonEmpty(embedded, filename, layout), so the
// folder is only consulted when the filename yields nothing. The scan now uses
// the same rule and the same helper for ebooks.

// stripLeadingPosition removes a "01 - " or "1. " position prefix from a name
// derived from a file or folder, and returns the number it removed ("" when
// there was nothing to remove). leadingNumRe already recognises the prefix;
// ParseFilename only applies it once a series is known, which leaves the
// common "Series/01 - Title.epub" shape parsing as title "01".
//
// The digit-count guard keeps a real title that opens with a year intact:
// "1984 - George Orwell" matches the same regex. Four digits are refused
// unless they are zero padded, because no year starts with a zero and a
// library that pads to four ("0001 - Title") is naming a position. A prefix
// with nothing after it is left alone too, so a file named "01.epub" keeps
// whatever little it has.
//
// Three digits are always taken, which is the one accepted miss: a title that
// is a bare number under 1000 followed by a separator, "100 - Bullets.epub",
// comes out as "Bullets". Refusing it would cost the real "001 - Title"
// libraries, which are far more common than that shape, and a file in a book
// folder still reaches its book through the layout tier. Anything that is not
// a bare number is unaffected, since the regex needs the number to be the
// whole prefix.

// parseScanFile is ParseFilename for the library scan, with a leading position
// number removed first for an EBOOK.
//
// ParseFilename strips that prefix only when it has already recognised a
// series, and a plain "The Wheel of Time" folder carries no series marker for
// it to recognise. So "01 - The Eye of the World (1990).epub" reaches the
// generic "Title - Author" split as "01 - The Eye of the World" and parses
// with title "01" and author "The Eye of the World". Removing the prefix
// before parsing gives the title the file actually names, and hands the number
// to the series tier when a series is known but unnumbered.
//
// Audiobooks are left exactly as ParseFilename read them, and the format gate
// is the whole reason this takes a format at all. scanTitle keeps the folder
// ahead of the filename for them, but a FLAT audiobook layout has no book
// folder to keep: with tracks directly in the author folder, "01 - Rocky.mp3"
// used to parse as title "01" and match nothing, and stripping the prefix
// would turn it into a confident match on a chapter name. That is #1239 with
// extra steps, and it is a regression the first draft of this fix shipped.
//
// The unstripped parse is kept as the fallback: if removing the prefix leaves
// nothing that parses as a title, the file is parsed as it always was.

// scanTitle picks the title the library scan matches a file on, given what the

//
// Audiobooks keep the folder first. A multi track audiobook is one book spread
// over files whose names are chapter or track names ("04 - Sinister Grey
// Mists.mp3"), so believing the filename there would give every track a
// different book and reconcile none of them (#1239), and would leave library
// adoption naming the unit after one track (representative, unmatched_units).
// The folder is the book for that layout, which is why this stays as it was.
