// until it cleared, and on trackers that count refused requests that keeps
// the window from clearing at all. A search the indexer answers steps the

// A Newznab 500 ("Request limit reached. Retry in 485 minutes.") is an explicit
// instruction, and so is an HTTP 429 from the host in front of the indexer
// (Cloudflare's "error code: 1015", which carries no <error> element and was
// missed until #2635). Before #1934 Bindery discarded the first: the classification in
// newznab.IsRateLimitError was consulted only to abort tier fall-through within
// a single search, so the next search — and every search for the next eight
// hours — sent another request the indexer had already refused. On indexers
// that count refused requests against the quota, that can stop the window ever
// clearing.
//
// State is in memory on the single shared *Searcher (cmd/bindery/main.go), so
// both the scheduler's auto-grab and the API's interactive search observe the
// same cooldowns. It is lost on restart, which costs one refused request per
// indexer per search afterwards — exactly the pre-#1934 behaviour, so a restart
// can only ever return to the old cost, never do worse. Persisting it waits on
// the indexer health-state work (#1935), which needs columns of its own.
