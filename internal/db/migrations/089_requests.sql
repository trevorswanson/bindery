-- Requests from the requester role: a person asks for a book or an author and
-- an admin approves or declines.
--
-- owner_user_id is the requester. It cascades on user delete: a request is
-- only meaningful to the person who made it, and nothing else points at it.
-- The books and authors an approval creates are owned by the requester through
-- the add pipeline, not through this table, so deleting a request never
-- deletes library data.
--
-- title and author_name are what the metadata provider said when the request
-- was made. The requester never supplies free text (security review S2).
-- payload_json is the server built add payload replayed at approval; it holds
-- the foreign ids and the media type and nothing the requester chose beyond
-- that.
--
-- status 'approving' is a claim held while an approval runs, so two admins
-- approving at once cannot both add. A claim older than a few minutes is
-- treated as abandoned (the process died mid approval) and can be retaken.
--
-- One row per owner, kind and foreign id: asking twice is a 409, not a second
-- row.
