-- Library adoption: the files a library scan could not match, one row per
-- book rather than per file.
--
-- Until now the scan wrote its unmatched files into the library.lastScan
-- settings blob, capped at 1000 entries, one entry per file. A row there had
-- no identity, so nothing could be decided about it: no ignore state, no
-- grouping of a 193 track audiobook into one book (#2547), and no way to mark
-- a file as dealt with. This table gives each unit a stable identity keyed by
-- its path, so a decision (adopted, ignored) survives the next scan.
--
-- state:
--   pending   the scan still finds this unit and nobody has decided yet
--   adopting  an adopt request holds the row (compare and swap claim)
--   adopted   files registered against book_id by an admin
--   undoing   an undo request holds the row
--   ignored   an admin said this unit is not a book to track
--
-- created_book_id and created_author_id are set only when the adopt request
-- itself inserted that row, which is what lets Undo remove them again without
-- touching a book or author that existed before. registered_paths_json lists
-- exactly the book_files rows the adopt inserted, each as its path and the
-- book it was registered to, so Undo never removes a row that has since moved
-- to another book. created_book_fingerprint records the created book as the
-- adoption left it; if it differs at Undo, someone has started using the book
-- and Undo keeps it.
--
-- An adopt writes each of these as soon as it exists, before the next side
-- effect, so a request that dies part way leaves a row that says exactly what
-- to reverse. claimed_at dates the claim for that recovery; updated_at cannot,
-- because every scan refreshes it.
--
-- member_paths_json holds the files that make up the unit. Adopt re-checks
-- each one on disk before registering anything, because the row may be hours
-- old by then.
--
-- Times are written by the repository in one fixed width UTC layout so the
-- purge and claim recovery comparisons can compare them as text.
