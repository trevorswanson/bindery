// every coverless work the author has, and #2578 measured it in the thousands
// for a prolific author. Most of those works are already in the library, and
// the only thing the enrichment gives them is a cover for a book that has none
// (the sync backfills an empty cover, #1748). The scheduled discovery job
// trades that away: it enriches only the works it may create, through
// EnrichMissingCovers, and leaves covers for existing coverless books to a
// manual refresh, which still enriches everything.

// served to callers that expect covers. A cached, enriched list is still
